            <title>How do I make Windows the default operating system to boot in the Grub menu?</title>
            <para>Perhaps you want Windows (or another OS) to be the default operating system in the boot menu instead of Linux Mint. You can do this as follows:</para>
            <para>First determine on which line of Grub’s boot menu is Windows (it’s often on line number 5, but not always). This line number is important to know, so write it down or remember it.</para>
            <para>Launch a terminal window. Type in the terminal:</para> 
            <screen>
                    <command>gksudo xed /etc/default/grub</command>
            </screen>
            <para>Press enter. Find the default boot line (nearly at the beginning). It should currently read GRUB_DEFAULT=0</para>
            <para>This is the default boot line. Grub starts counting at 0, so 0 is the first line in the boot menu. Keep this in mind when making a change, because if Windows is at line 5 in your Grub menu, you have to change the 0 into 4: GRUB_DEFAULT=4</para>
            <para>Save and close the configuration file. Finally, apply the change by regenerating the Grub menu with the following command:</para>
             <screen>
                    <command>sudo update-grub</command>
            </screen>

            <title>Why is my system time changing between Windows and Linux Mint?</title>
            <para>If you're dual-booting Linux Mint and Windows, you may find that changing time in one system affects the other and that the two systems can't display the same time. This happens because Linux Mint 18 interprets the hardware clock or real time clock (RTC) in universal time by default, while Windows maintains the clock in local time. You can fix this by keeping RTC in local time in Linux Mint (the same as in Windows). Run the command below in the terminal:</para>
            <screen>
                    <command>timedatectl set-local-rtc 1 --adjust-system-clock</command>
            </screen>
